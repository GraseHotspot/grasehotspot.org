As you may have noticed, I’ve not posted the 3.7 release, however it has been released, back in January.  
However, I was looking forward to announcing a 3.7 update soon which includes some massive improvements in database calls for the displaying users page. We went from &gt;1000 database calls to a fixed 9 for display all the users, as well as a much faster loading time. However this release is going to be delayed now due to my computer dieing recently. Until I can replace my computer I’m very limited in what I can do. No work has been lost as everything is nicely backed up, and the hard drive is fine anyway. So now we need to wait until we can afford a replacement computer (really, just the inside components, CPU, RAM, Motherboard) and then I can transplant them into my old case and we’ll be roaring away.

This is really disappointing for me, as I’m 1/2 way through the paypal integration, so you can allow customers to purchase tickets via paypal and credit card.

This is the new computer we are hoping to buy from pccasegear.com. Case, Powersupply and HDD’s are extras but are things we wanted to purchase in the near future anyway (HDD’s will be in RAID1 array for backup purposes to replace a NAS that is no longer suitable).
