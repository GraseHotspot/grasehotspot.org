As you may have noticed, I’ve not posted the 3.7 release, however it has been released, back in January.  
However, I was looking forward to announcing a 3.7 update soon which includes some massive improvements in database calls for the displaying users page. We went from &gt;1000 database calls to a fixed 9 for display all the users, as well as a much faster loading time. However this release is going to be delayed now due to my computer dieing recently. Until I can replace my computer I’m very limited in what I can do. No work has been lost as everything is nicely backed up, and the hard drive is fine anyway. So now we need to wait until we can afford a replacement computer (really, just the inside components, CPU, RAM, Motherboard) and then I can transplant them into my old case and we’ll be roaring away.

This is really disappointing for me, as I’m 1/2 way through the paypal integration, so you can allow customers to purchase tickets via paypal and credit card.
