With a burst of energy, I’ve found time again to work on trying to get the work done out as a stable release! Thanks to everyone who is testing the nightly builds.

I’ve also realised that people don’t realise how much you can customise the login screen. Have a look at <https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/wiki/Login-Page-Customisation-Examples> for some examples! If you have an awesome customised login page, please add a screenshot! I’ve also written some details about how you customise the login screen <https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/wiki/Customising-Login-Page>

Hopefully in the next week or so, I’ll have ironed out all the bugs stopping the release, and we’ll move on to release candidates on the dev channel!

Version 3.8 here we come!
