And finally, 3.8.0 is released! Here is a quick run down on what’s new!

- New login page! See <https://grasehotspot.org/2014/05/20/new-login-coming-soon/> for more details. It’s mobile friendly, and looks great. Still can be fully customised like the previous page.
- Free Access user. Auto creates an account for users. Also known as a ‘Just accept Terms of Service’ style login.
- [See the Github Tracker for more details of what has changed! ](https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/issues?q=milestone%3A3.8+is%3Aclosed)
- [You can also look at the Changelog for more details](https://github.com/GraseHotspot/grase-www-portal/blob/3.8.0/debian/changelog)

Where to from here?
===================

I have been slowly working on a branch that cleans up lots of the classes, and is working on reimplementing the admin interface (and in the future the captive portal pages) on Symfony. This is going to take a little while, but brings us to the present day in terms of frameworks. It’ll make a huge difference to the speed of development compared to the mishmash of php scripts that is the “Radmin” code. Hopefully it’ll also encourage others to get involved. More details of what the looks like will be coming soon!
