We have a live demo of the admin pages available at <https://demo.grasehotspot.org/grase/radmin/>. The login is **guest** and password is **guest**. While the demo is reset hourly, please don’t change the username or password of the admin user, or do anything to purposely break it. If you find a bug, please report it.

You can also preview the login page at <https://demo.grasehotspot.org/grase/uam/?res=notyet> which tricks the system into thinking it’s running on a real hotspot. However, you won’t be able to actually login with that form, just see what it looks like.

The demo should be running a recent nightly, however, if you notice that it’s running an older version and wish to try the latest nightly, just drop me a line via the Contact form and I’ll update the demo.

The Demo should be reset hourly.

There is also a demo of the nightly builds available at <https://devdemo.grasehotspot.org/grase/login> however this may be broken or out of date as it’s not an automated process keeping it running at the moment. You can also demo the login page at <https://devdemo.grasehotspot.org/grase/uam?res=notyet>
