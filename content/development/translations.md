If GRASE Hotspot isn’t available in your language, please consider doing a translation for it! It doesn’t take much work, and you will be credited with the translation! Please join our [mailing list](https://grasehotspot.org/mailing-list/ "Mailing List") so we can notify all the translators when there are new strings to be translated, and so that duplicate work isn’t done.

Translations are currently moving. Please stay tuned on the mailing list for how to help with V4 translations!
