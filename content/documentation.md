This area is for the documentation of the GRASE Hotspot System.

Follow the links on the right hand side to find what you are looking for. If you are wanting to setup a hotspot, youâ€™ll first need an ubuntu or debian server. Read [Ubuntu Server Installation](https://grasehotspot.org/documentation/ubuntu-server-installation/ "Ubuntu Server Installation") to get started. If you already have a server, head straight to [Installation](https://grasehotspot.org/documentation/installation/ "Installation").

If you just want to see what the system looks like, there is a demo of the admin interface. Goto [Demo](https://grasehotspot.org/2011/04/05/demo/ "Demo") for instructions.
