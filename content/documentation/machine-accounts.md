Machine accounts give you the ability to create an account associated with a computer that automatically logs into the hotspot without any user action. It is locked to the computers [MAC Address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address "wikipedia:MAC address"), and the account is put into the Machine group. This locks the editing of the account (to be changed in a later version of GRASE).

To create a machine account, you need the MAC address in the format XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX (so not using : and everything uppercase). Add this as the username <del>and then the password as ‘password</del>‘ (To change soon so you can change it for your individual install). <del>Select the Machine group (and don’t set any limits otherwise when it expires it will revert to a normal user login).</del>
