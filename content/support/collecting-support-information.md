If you need to collect information about your system to assist with people providing support on the mailing list, you can run the following commands that will gather the common bits of information we need to make it easier to send with your support request. Feel free to review the collect-support-info.sh file before running the second command.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GraseHotspot/support-info/master/collect-support-info.sh

bash collect-support-info.sh
```
